📊 Analysis Workflow
1. Basic Data Exploration
•	Checked shape, column types, missing values.
•	Reviewed summary statistics and value distributions.
2. Missing Value Treatment
•	Filled missing Age values with median.
•	Filled missing Embarked values with mode.
•	Ignored Cabin column due to excessive missing data.
3. Univariate Analysis
•	Studied distributions of Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch.
•	Identified skewness and outliers.
4. Bivariate Analysis
•	Visualized the relationship between Survived and:
o	Sex
o	Pclass
o	Age & Fare (scatter)
5. Correlation Analysis
•	Generated correlation heatmap to study the strength of relationships.
•	Highlighted key predictors of survival.
6. Visual Insights
•	Pairplots, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots.
•	Observations recorded for each visual.
7. Summary of Findings
•	Top insights compiled into an easy-to-read conclusion.

📝 Key Findings
•	Gender & Class had the highest influence on survival.
•	Higher Fare → Higher survival probability.
•	1st Class passengers survived considerably more.
•	Majority of passengers were 20–40 years old.
•	Most passengers traveled alone, lowering survival chances.

🚀 Output
This task provides:
•	A cleaned, analyzed dataset
•	Insightful visualizations
•	A professional report ready for submission
•	Clear understanding of factors affecting Titanic passenger survival
